\section{Maximally symmetric spaces}
Consider $\mathbb{R}^n$, this space is highly symmetric: clearly it is isotropic and homogeneous, or, in a simpler way, every point and every direction are the same in $\mathbb{R}^n$.\\
This means that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is symmetric under every type of rotation and translations: in $n$-dimensions there are $n$ possible translations (along the $n$ axes) and $n\frac{n-1}{2}$ possible rotations (for each axis we can rotate it towards $n-1$ other axes and to avoid double counting $x\rightarrow y$ and $y\rightarrow x$ we divide by $2$), for a total of $$n+n\frac{n-1}{2}=n\frac{n+1}{2}$$ symmetries.\\

An $n$-dimensional manifold is said to be \textbf{maximally symmetric} if it possesses the same number of symmetries of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the differential geometry language, a symmetry is defined through isometries, that are just diffeomorphism under which the metric tensor is invariant.
